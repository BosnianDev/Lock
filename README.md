# Lock

## Introduction

Very simple app to lock the screen.

I use it with [FAST][1] launcher to quickly
lock the screen (either clicking the icon or typing "lk") because I miss my previous launcher feature "lock with double
click on home button".
I tried a series of apps that were not comfortable with FAST launcher because
they required too much steps to lock the screen.

Its behavior is very simple: on first run it will ask the required device
administrator permission and then it will lock the screen. On next launches, it
will immediately lock the screen.

## Uninstalling
